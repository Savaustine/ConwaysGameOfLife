# ConwaysGameOfLife
Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.  It is a classic example of cellular automate. The game is played on a grid, where each cell can be in one of two states: alive (colourd) or dead (uncoloured).
