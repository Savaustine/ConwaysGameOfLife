# Conway's Game of Life

## Overview

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## Description

This project is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a classic example of cellular automate. The game is played on a grid, where each cell can be in one of two states: alive (colourd) or dead (uncoloured). The cells evolve from one generation to the next based on a set of rules, creating fascinating patterns and behaviOUrs.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface:** The simulation is presented through a web-based UI that allows you to control and observe the game's evolution.
- **Start, Stop, and Pause:** You can initiate the simulation, pause it, or halt it altogether.
- **Clear the Grid:** Reset the grid to its initial state and start a new simulation.
- **Adjustable Speed:** Change the speed of the simulation to observe different rates of evolution.
- **Manual Generation Step:** Advance through generations manually to observe how patterns develop over time.
- **Generation Count:** Keep track of the current generation count.

## Prerequisites

- Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x:** Download and install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Flask:** Install via `pip install flask`.

## Access the Game

- This project is hosted on the REPL Online IDE Platform, it will be accessible via the provided URL: ![URL](https://replit.com/@Savaustine1/ConwaysGameOfLife)

## How to Compile and Run

- GO to https://replit.com/@Savaustine1/ConwaysGameOfLife
- Navigate to `Shell`(REPL Terminal)
- Ensure that you are in the project directory ![Project directory](~/ConwaysGameOfLife$) or navigate to the project directory using `cd` command.
- In the project directory, type the following command: `python main.py` and hit enter to start the Flask app.
- Copy the URL that is provided in the `Webview`, and paste it in a web browser. This allow you to view and interact with Conway's Game of Life on the web.

## Getting Started On Your Local Machine

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the project directory using `cd`.
3. Run the Python script with `python main.py`.
4. Access the simulation in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`. or `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## How to Play

- Click the "Start" button to begin the simulation.
- Click "Stop" to pause it. You can resume by clicking "Resume" (same button).
- "Clear" resets the grid to its initial state.
- "Speed" allows you to switch between "Normal" and "Fast" speed.
- "Step" manually advances the simulation by one generation.
- "Generation Status" displays the current generation count.


## Screenshots

- Screenshots that shows the initial state, and when simulation has started is found in this folder: ![images](C:\Users\USER\ConwayGoL\images).

## Technologies Used

- Python (Flask)
